# Fitness Calculator

## Project Description
This is a GUI-based project crafted for the CS-470 Final Project

This calculator is developed with the goal of facilitating fitness needs based on body physiological features and measurements.

The program contains 5 main functions:
1. Ideal Weight Calculator
2. Daily Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator
3. Daily Calorie Intake Planner
4. Weight Record
5. Diet Planner

## Project Structure 
`src/calculator/gui` contains the program entry point `Main.java` and all the relative GUIs

`src/calculator/functions` contains the Main.java and all the relative classes implemented for business logic

`food_db.csv` is a dataset built based on a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utsavdey1410/food-nutrition-dataset) of food nutrition data that will be read in for users to input food items during runtime

`sample_diet_data.csv` is a demonstration of the diet calorie record exported by the Diet Planner

## How to run
